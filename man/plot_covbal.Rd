\description{
Visualize covariate balance at the discontinuity
}
\details{
Covariate balance tests allow us to visualize
whether important characteristics differ on either side
of the regression discontinuity boundary.

The sum_method indicates how data is meant to be binned
for visualization purposes. Currently it defaults to "raw"
but it will also accept "mean", "median", and "pointrange",
which will plot a point-range for each bin on the x axis.

The fit_method argument defaults to a linear regression
using all the data. Other acceptable arguments are "loess"
for local linear regression, "gam" for generalized additive
models, "quadratic" for a quadratic fit using the whole
dataset.
